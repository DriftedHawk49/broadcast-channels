# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" and "develop" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "develop" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main", "develop" ]
